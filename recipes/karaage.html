        <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol class="Instructions karaage">
                <li>Line up 4 or 5 the shishito pepper and punch a whole near the top using skewers. This prevents the pepper from exploding during the frying process.</li>
                <li>The contents of A will become marinade. Take the soy sauce, sake, mirin, sugar, grated garlic, and chili oil and mix them well in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Take the chicken meat and lay them skin side down. Cut them along the fibre 4-6 times, and then cut them perpendicular to the fibre 4-6 times.</li>
                <li>Take the marinade from step 2 and mix the chicken meat in it. Marinate for 10 min and then flip and marinate another 10 min.</li>
                <li>Remove the chicken from the marinade and let dry be putting it in a strainer. Do not dry with paper towel as this will remove umami.</li>
                <li>Roll the chicken in potato starch until the chicken is completely white.</li>
                <li>Fill the pan until it is 1-2cm deep in cooking oil and heat to 160cm. Put the chicken in 1 by one. Let fry until light browning. This should take around 2 min and 30 sec.</li>
                <li>When the surface has hardened, flip the chicken. Let fry again until golden brown. This should take around 1 min and 30 sec.</li>
                <li>When checking the chicken, use the last piece placed in the pan.</li>
                <li>After removing the chicken, use the remaining oil to fry the shishito peppers. Salt lightly and place on with the chicken along with a slice of lemon.</li>
