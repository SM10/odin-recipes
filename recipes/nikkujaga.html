        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>200g of shredded beef</li>
            <li>4 potatoes</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>8 snow peas</li>
            <li>200g of konnyaku noodles</li>
            <li>
                A
                <ul>
                    <li>2.5 water</li>
                    <li>Half a cup of sake</li>
                    <li>5 tablespoons of sugar</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons of mirin</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of salad oil</li>
            <li>A pinch of cayenne peppers</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the skin off the potatoes. Cut the potatoes into 4-6 pieces and soak in water. Cut the onion vertically into 4 equal pieces, then cut it once horizontally.</li>
            <li>Peel the thread off the of the snow peas. Boil in slightly salted water until the color changes, then remove with a strainer.</li>
            <li>Boil the konnyaku noodles for about one minute. Remove with a strainer and cut to a length either to eat. This process removes the caustic smells.</li>
            <li>If the beef pieces are too big, cut them to down to bitesized. Untangle any beef pieces that are bundled together.</li>
            <li>Heat some salad oil in a pan on medium heat. Fry the potatoes until all sides have softened and slightly transparent.</li>
            <li>Move the potatoes to the side and begin frying the beef.</li>
            <li>When the color of the beef has changed, add water and sake from A and raise the heat to strong. Add the onions and konnyaku. Keep them seperated in the pan.</li>
            <li>Once it begins boiling, turn to low heat and remove the scum. Add in the sugar and mirin from A. Add the sugar into the mirin beforehand so it spreads easier. Put a sheet of aluminum foil on top and let simmer for 20 min.</li>
            <li>When water level reaches half of what it was, add the soy sauce from A.</li>
            <li>Remove the aluminum foil and let simmer again for another 7-8 minutes. Once the water is almost boiled out, move it onto a dish. Add the snow peas and cayenne pepper on top.</li>
        </ol>
